    "Big Mountain Resort has recently installed an additional chair lift to help\n",
    "increase the distribution of visitors but this increased their operation cost. \n",
    "Even though they are charging a premium above the average price in the market but there's a suspicion that Big\n",
    "Mountain is not capitalizing on its facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal here is to review the data given by the database manager and to come up with a strategy and model \n",
    "on selecting a better value for the ticket price and to suggest a number of changes that they hope will either cut costs\n",
    "without undermining the ticket price or will support an even higher ticket price to increase the revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to build a model the data was reviewed thouroughly. The data had issue that some of the value has more than \n",
    "50% of missing value and some of the value, such as skiable area in Silverton Mountain and yearsOpen variable that was \n",
    "possibly caused during data collection. The records with missing were thrown out, but not before making the most of the \n",
    "other available data to look for any patterns between the states. \n",
    "You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After data was cleaned by dropping missing value columns or filling up missing values \n",
    "through imputation, reviewing descriptive statistics had begun.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clean data was joined with summary_state file that has information on each states and it's ski related information. \n",
    "In order to investigate state and the ticket price, PCA was used to deep dive high dimensional data. From PCA analysis \n",
    "it was found out that there was a spread of states across the first component and New Hampshire and Vermind were off \n",
    "on their own a little in the second dimentsion although they're really no more extreme than New York and Colorado \n",
    "are in the first dimension. When the second component was investigated, it was found that \n",
    "resorts_per_100kcapita and resorts_per_100ksq_mile might count for quite a lot, in a positive sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the descriptive statistics, the model building process had begun. We first used median to fill out \n",
    "missing values. Afterwards, we ran linear regression with crossvalidation=5 folding, we could see that there were 8 features\n",
    "that matters. The vertical drop and Snow Making_ac and total_chairs were top 3 coefficient that impacts the model output \n",
    "and it was consistent with our findings during EDA steps. Likewise when we ran random forest, FastQuad, Runs and Snow Making _ac \n",
    "were the top3 most important features in random forest regressor, which was somewhat common with linear model.\n",
    "When we compared linear regression model and random forest model performance, random forest model had a lower CV MAE by almost 1 \n",
    "and produce less variablility. As for the data quantity assessment it turns out that CV score levels off \n",
    "once it reached the sample size of 40-50.\n",
    "\n",

    "Big Mountain is currently charging $81 for Adult Weekend. In terms of price it is higher end of the ski resort market \n",
    "in that majority of the ticket price is distributed close to $50. Even when compared with other resort in the market \n",
    "(in Montana) it has the highest ticket price that the rest of the resort is charging less than $70. However, when \n",
    "considered Big Mountain’s facility, it has above average facilities, especially average Vertical Drop, Snow making area \n",
    "is positioned at very high end in the market share and the rest of others like Total number of chairs, Fast Quads, \n",
    "Runs, Longest Run and Skiable terrain area is positioned at very higher-end of total distribution. That could explain \n",
    "premium price, however there were still room to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario When the runs are closed, there are large revenue drops after 8 run closure (-$3)\n",
    "The second scenario which is adding a run + increase vertical drop + installing chair lift supports \n",
    "ticket price increase by $1.27 and additional revenue amount by 2.2mil. \n",
    "At last, adding 1 additional chair doesn’t support price increase, but adding 2 chairs will support ticket price increase \n",
    "by $2.06 and it will bring $3.6 million. Also adding 3 chairs will support price increase by $5 dollar and bring \n",
    "$9.6 million additional revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seen from this modeling, what we can do is to come up with profit maximazation formular that combines number of runs \n",
    "and increase vertical drop and installing chair list using the predictive model that we came up with. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, we were able to find out that there is rooms for the improvement. Even though Big Mountain is charging premium price \n",
    "compared to other resort, many of its facility is located at the very high end of total distribution. Throughout this modeling \n",
    "exercise we ran linear model and random forest model and we identified that run clousure, increase vertical drop and installing \n",
    "chair lift supports price increase and additional revenue. However, at this point we only know the cost of the additional \n",
    "chair installation and no information was given for the rest of other variables. We would need to connect the dots by getting \n",
    "full cost information and based on this, Big Mountain will be able to come up with a profit maximization model.\n",
